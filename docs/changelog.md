# Changelog

Newest first. One entry per phase; approach changes and gate revisions go in
[impl-plan.md](impl-plan.md) instead.

## 0: workspace and common primitives (2026-08-15)

**Added**

- Cargo workspace, edition 2024, eleven crates with the dependency direction enforced by the
  manifest. Directories are unprefixed; package names carry `lowlat-`. The shared library
  target is named `lowlat`, so it links as `liblowlat`.
- `lowlat-common`:
  - `clock`: monotonic time, **fractional-millisecond** intervals, absolute-deadline sleep
    built from `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` with a 200 us spin finish.
  - `wait`: address-based wait and wake over the raw futex on Linux, with a bucketed portable
    fallback. Wait and notify live in one module because they are one primitive.
  - `spsc`: bounded single-producer single-consumer ring, fixed capacity, no allocation after
    construction, never blocks, never grows.
  - `seq`: RFC 1982 serial comparisons.
  - `bytes`: bounds-checked fixed-width wire accessors, all returning options.
  - `log`: leveled logging with an application sink; trace compiled out in release.
  - `alloc_counter`: thread-local counting allocator behind a test-only feature.
- Deterministic swap of atomics and cells for model checking, so one body of ring code serves
  both the real build and `loom`.
- CI: ASCII check, format, clippy with warnings denied, tests, release build, model checking,
  dependency and license audit, sanitizers.
- `deny.toml`. The GPL denial is load bearing: codec libraries are loaded at runtime and never
  linked, and this is what makes a violation a build failure rather than a discipline.
- Pre-commit hook running the ASCII check on staged files.

**Notes**

- **The model check was shown capable of failing.** Weakening the producer's release store to
  relaxed makes `loom` report a causality violation. A passing check that has never failed is
  not yet evidence.
- **The ASCII checker was found silently passing.** It reported success while examining zero
  files, because a directory argument fell through its file filter. Fixed to expand
  directories, and the incident is cited in [08-testing.md](08-testing.md) 8 as the concrete
  case for the harness rule.
- Hardware encode confirmed working in the development VM by `scripts/probe-capture.sh`
  stage 3: 1080p60, 60 frames. That is what Phase 5 depends on, and it is now measured rather
  than inferred.
- Gate 3's wording was corrected from "strictly monotonic" to non-decreasing-and-advancing.
  The platform guarantees the former, not the latter, and asserting strict increase would test
  the timer's resolution rather than our contract.
